Description:
AlphaRun is a running game with a twist. It is a computer graphics project developed on OpenGL as a part of our college curriculum.
It involves two stick characters who are constantly moving on the screen and a random string of characters flowing at the bottom of the screen.
Each string is composed of 5 characters and for each string that the user is able to match by clicking the corresponding button on the screen, the 
user's stick man while get a bonus of 100 units and for each character that the user misses out on, the stick man gets a penalty of 20 units. 
To make the game tougher, the CPU stick man always advances by 5 units greater than the USER stick man.
